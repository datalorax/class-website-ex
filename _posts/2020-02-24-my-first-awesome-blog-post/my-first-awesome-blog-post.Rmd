Check it out. Here's an amazing plot, with [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org).

```{r plot}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, cty)) +
  geom_point(color = "gray70") +
  geom_smooth() +
  theme_minimal()
```

This was produced with the following data (note, only first six rows shown).

```{r data}
library(gt)
mpg %>% 
  head() %>% 
  gt()
```
